    <h1>Career Coaching with Terri Burns</h1>
    <h3><b>About</b><h3>
        <h3>I’m (almost!) a certified professional coach, focusing on career and leadership coaching. In a few months, I’ll be receiving my coaching certification from Leadership that Works’ <a class="back-home" href="http://www.leadershipthatworks.com/Public/CoachTraining/index.cfm">Coaching for Transformation (CFT)</a>. CFT is a course that’s accredited by the <a /class="back-home" href="https://coachfederation.org/">International Coach Federation</a> (legit!).</h3>
    <h3>My coaching focus is with leaders —particularly young, ambitious, career-oriented folks— who are seeking meaning and balance in their professional and personal lives. I provide an open, confidential space for young bo$$es to reflect, goal-set, be held accountable, and find personal alignment. My clients can expect to further develop their careers, better honor what's driving them, and unlock a new level of professional fulfillment and leadership.</h3>
    <h3>My only ask of clients is to be open and willing to put in the work.</h3>
    <h3><b>What even is coaching?</b><h3>
    <h3>Coaching is a powerful, ongoing relationship that helps you focus to better realize your visions and goals. With a professional coach, you get the tools and support to remove obstacles and facilitate change. Some examples of reasons people come to coaching: to plan a career move, to make your present job more fulfilling, to plan your life based on your true values, to get more organized, to focus your energy, to finish or plan a project.</h3>

    <h3><b>What people are saying</b><h3>
    <h3><i>“Terri is a one-of-a-kind individual who can make a connection with anyone — even a stranger sharing a Lyft ride, (which is how we met). I told her about a unique situation I had at work, and she immediately asked intriguing questions that got me thinking. We had a followup conversation a few days later where she offered me some coaching advice. Even in 25 minutes, she transformed the way I think about my career, both in the short-term and long-term. Terri is going to be an incredible coach, and her compassion and intuition for people is going to get her far in life.” -Erin</i></h3>
    <h3><b>FAQ</b><h3>
    <h3><b>How is coaching done?</b><h3>
    <h3>Typically, individual coaching is done by telephone or video conference, with two, hourlong sessions each month. To create profound changes in your life, I ask for a minimum six-session commitment.</h3>
    <h3><b>Is coaching therapy?</b></h3>
    <h3>Nope. Coaching focuses on personal growth, strategic planning, and does not attempt to heal emotional trauma. Coaches regularly refer clients to other professionals for issues that are better suited for a therapeutic relationship.</h3>
    <h3><b>What is a typical session like?</b></h3>
    <h3>The hallmark of coaching is self-responsibility. The client helps set the agenda for the call, which the coach helps guide. You can expect transformational  questions, focused planning, and accountability tools.</h3>
    <h3><b>$ How much? $</b></h3>
    <h3>Contact me via the form above (or go <a class="back-home" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeX5ENVlZXUCUpnxVG1V8_T8iNueg1hbYNoZ4ceUjpNKcVhWg/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>), and I’d be happy to follow up with information on pricing. Coaching is certainly an investment, and if you’re cautious about spending, here are three things you can do to maximize your investment:<br>1. Hire the right coach. (While I hope that’s me, it totally doesn’t have to be and I’d be happy to help you find the right one!) The right coach is one who’s specialties best match your needs, who’s style and focus align with yours. During your first coaching session, set a 90-day goal that’s worth accomplishing.<br>2. Make the most of your coaching time. Tell your coach what results you want and your coach helps you make it happen.</h3>

Should we choose to continue, we’ll schedule subsequent coaching sessions and you’ll receive a “Welcome to Coaching” virtual package which includes some self-assessment and planning tools. And that’s just the beginning!</h3>
