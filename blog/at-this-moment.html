      <h2>Since I just graduated from NYU with a degree in computer science(!), I thought I&#39;d write out some updates from the last few months, plus sneak a peek into the future. Most of my work is on my <a href="index.html">website</a>, and I <a href="https://twitter.com">tweet</a> updates regularly as well. <br></h2>

      <h2><b>In February</b>, I wrote about <a href="https://helloflo.com/what-i-learned-about-feminism-through-code/">feminism and coding</a> for HelloFlo, a company that provides one-of-a-kind care packages to people with periods. I also turned 22 in February* (on 2/22; it was cool), and celebrated with a <a href="birthday.html">four-part email newsletter</a> and fundraising campaign. The newsletter helped raise over $600 for <a href="https://www.transhack.org/">Trans*H4CK</a>. I ended the month at Interact, a summit in Lake Tahoe, California, where 100 makers and technologists got together and hung out.</h2>

      <h2><b>In March</b>, (amongst a brief stint in Barbados for Spring Break,) I wrote a lot. I wrote a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/stem-student-spotlight-jason-kang1/">Scientific American piece</a> about the student founder of Kinnos, a startup that&#39;s building tools to fight Ebola. I also wrote two pieces for Model View Culture: The first is on how discrimination in tech manifests in student communities, and is <a href="https://model-view-culture.myshopify.com/products/2016-quarterly-subscription">only available in print</a>. The second is all about the tech industry&#39;s emphasis on side projects, which is available <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/side-project-culture-opportunities-and-obstacles-for-marginalized-people-in-tech">here</a>.</h2>

      <h2><b>In April</b>, <a href="https://techatnyu.org/">Tech@NYU</a>*&mdash;the largest student technology organization in NYC which I&#39;ve been a part of for the last three years&mdash;hosted an incredible <a href="https://nyusw.com/">Startup Week</a>. We held events at various tech companies in the city, including Microsoft, Tumblr, Clarifai, and MongoDB. The following week, startup founder/co host <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahkunst?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Sarah Kunst</a> and I launched <a href="https://www.forbes.com/podcasts/well-technically/#10a192764b33">Well, Technically</a>, a new podcast with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/podcasts/#5ff1ebd967f7">Forbes&#39; new podcasting network</a>.  In addition to talking about (you guessed it&hellip;) technology, we also like talking about startups, corporate America, pop culture, and well, everything else.  Later in the month, I traveled (back!) to Abu Dhabi for a hackathon on social good in the Arab world. My team and I had fun building a Twitter sentiment analyzer/visualization that works with 100+ languages, but (in classic hackathon fashion) it crashed just before we could deploy. (Maybe one day we&#39;ll fix it and ship it. Who knows.)</h2>

    <h2><b>In May</b>, I officially transitioned from President to Chair of Tech@NYU after a wonderful year as President. I am so grateful for my Tech@NYU family; <a href="https://medium.com/in-context">they are more than I could have asked for</a>. I also became an <a href="https://blogs.forbes.com/terriburns">editorial contributor at Forbes</a> (much Forbes, I know), where I&#39;ll soon be writing about technology, podcasting, and offering tips on getting your life together via hand-drawn data visualizations.  I wrote a second Scientific American piece about We Read Too, an app by the lovely <a href="https://kmt901.github.io/">Kaya Thomas</a>, which you can read <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/stem-student-spotlight-kaya-thomas/">here</a>. I hacked together my last final projects ~ever~ for my computer science classes. Then, I graduated! It was glorious. Absolutely glorious.</h2>

      <h2><b>This summer</b>, I&#39;ll be (back!) in California, mentoring for <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> while helping people debug some of their very first programs. I'll still be pushing plenty of content to Forbes, and I&#39;m also still debating whether or not to resurrect my <a href="https://tinyletter.com/tcburning">newsletter</a>, indefinitely this time. Speaking of California, I&#39;ll be moving to San Francisco towards the end of August to start my new adventure as an Associate Product Manager at Twitter (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/mvpm-minimum-viable-product-manager-e1aeb8dd421#.megj63q2l">what&#39;s that?</a>). I will miss New York very much.</h2>

      <h2><b>At this moment in time</b>, I&#39;m mostly excited for the vacation trips I have planned (Bali, Tokyo, and London -- food recommendations highly encouraged), seeing so many of my friends and family members (thank you all for everything), and the box of cookies right in front of me (no regrets). In the last four years, I learned to code, traveled around the world, fell in love, ate a lot of pizza, and proudly managed to never move to Brooklyn!</h2>
