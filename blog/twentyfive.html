      <h5>25</h5>
      <h2>Three years ago, I ended my (now kind of cringy, but still kind of good) <a href="http://tcburning.com/birthday">birthday newsletter series</a> with a list of <a href="https://tinyletter.com/tcburning/letters/blessings">22 Blessings</a>.  It‚Äôs interesting to look back at this list and see all of the things that have changed: I‚Äôm <a href="https://twitter.com/tcburning/status/1076168242752704513">not really much of a texter anymore</a>, I think I‚Äôm better at telling my parents I appreciate them, and I spend (a little) less of my free time thinking about all of the desserts that I love (though to be clear, my annual tradition of <a href="https://twitter.com/tcburning/status/834592850524319744">buying and eating an entire red velvet cake</a> for myself will continue. I estimate that this will have to end at age 28 or so). In other ways, I have not evolved at all: Take Care is still one of my favorite albums, I never miss my manicure appointments, and New York still feels like a long-lost friend. I‚Äôve <a href="http://tcburning.com/blog/ending-2018">already explained that I've entered 2019 with optimism</a>, and the same goes with entering my 25th year. I'm feeling real good about it, it y'all! So here are 25 blessings:</h2>
      <h2>1. Early mornings on weekdays, late nights on weekends.<br>
        2. <i> Needy</i> by Ariana Grande.<br>
        4. A moment to myself early this morning. I went on a walk when the city was still quiet and the sun was rising. Love a good start to the day.<br>
        4. People that don‚Äôt work in tech.<br>
        5. Room temperature water.<br>
        6. Last weekend with my best friends in Arizona. Last night&#39;s pizza dinner with Sequoia, Jackie, and Freia. This morning&#39;s SoulCycle class (Barry&#39;s was full) with Nate and Aliza. My weekend getaway festivities with 12 of my homies.<br>
        7. My friend Potluck for pushing me to celebrate bigger this year.<br>
        8. Finding a new, amazing hair braider in Oakland.<br>
        9. Saying goodbye.<br>
        10. Renewed clarity in my work/job.</br>
        11. Knowing when to occasionally break a good habit.<br>
        12. Sunshine in San Francisco after weeks of rain.<br>
        13. Steven Universe. <br>
        14. Moving on, even just a little bit at a time.<br>
        15. Getting through an entire day with good posture.<br>
        16. Tequila.<br>
        17. When someone cancels a plan that you wanted to cancel anyway.<br>
        18. Long phone calls with friends/family.<br>
        19. When someone says ‚Äúit be like that sometimes" and you really feel it.<br>
        20. When someone says ‚ÄúOmg, I have so much to update you on,‚Äù so you sit back and grab the popcorn.<br>
        21. Warm hands.<br>
        22. Skincare.<br>
        23. A few weeks ago I ate a late-night burrito for the first time in over a year. It was so, so good. I‚Äôm still thinking about it weeks later. A true blessing!<br>
        24. Inbox 0.<br>
        25. Friday birthdaysüç∞<br><br>
        Happy birthday to me! #TCBDay
