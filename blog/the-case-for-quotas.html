      <h5>The Case for Quotas</h5>
      <h2>
        Earlier this year, Governor Jerry Brown of California signed <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB826">Senate Bill 826</a> into law, mandating that public companies based in California have at least one woman on their Board of Directors by the end of 2019. This is the first bill of its kind for California and the country at large. As a computer science graduate, a venture capitalist, and perhaps most importantly, as a in born-and-bred black Californian woman, I'm ecstatic about this exciting step in an important direction. Having studied and worked in environments where diversity was both lacking but also top of mind for the institutions I was a part of, it has become clear to me that quotas present a unique opportunity to increase diversity much faster than alternative methods. Legislative quotas in academia and the corporate sector are a direct and efficient means of increasing the diversity of institutions. As such, the introduction of more legislative quotas is a worthwhile opportunity for diversity advocates.

      <h2>
        America has an intricate history with diversity and inclusion, ultimately shaping the importance of quotas in education and employment today. In 1961, John F. Kennedy signed <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/thelaw/eo-10925.html">Executive Order 10925</a>, mandating that  contractors “will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.” This order coined the term “affirmative action,” which was loosely defined and arguably more demonstrative of a value (equal opportunity), than a concrete plan. The executive order didn't come out of nowhere; it reflected a broken system that has existed through the development of America, one that has perpetually given minorities fewer opportunities to live a productive and fulfilling life. Because it was loosely defined, affirmative action was not specific enough for employers (or educational institutions) to establish clear policies in order to affirmatively act. But in 1978, institutions were given another data point to guide their thinking: in a landmark decision, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the Supreme Court upheld the general premise of affirmative action but deemed racial quotas for institutions supported by the government as unconstitutional. Forty years later and we are left with the continued underrepresentation of minorities in education and corporate America. Clearly, there is an opportunity for the disruption and improvement of our policies. While an imperfect system due to legal challenges, quotas can be that opportunity.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Many universities take a holistic approach for student admittance, meaning that race is one of many factors that go into deciding whether or not a student is admitted. This is an important approach considering the unconstitutionality of racial quotas specifically, but also the important history of acknowledging the racial backgrounds of candidates. For California, this approach ended in 1996 with the passing of Proposition 209, which prevents public institutions in California from considering race (among other factors) in admissions decisions. After this legislation went into effect, the number of admitted African-Americans dropped 55% within a three-year period. Relatedly, employers are allowed collect racial and other similar background information from applicants, but cannot lean on it definitively for employment decisions. Despite potential legal risk, both educators and employers continue to collect background information on candidates as it pertains to diversity and inclusion. Frankly, the information is useful; it's impossible to build a diverse population without knowing and weighing information like race and gender to a certain degree. Despite the unconstitutionality of racial quotas, and the illegality of weighing race and gender in California’s public institutions (as well as other states with similar legislation), there are still opportunities for quotas to exist, as seen with the passing of Senate Bill 826. (There are some people challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 826, though it may not be implicated because it does not directly involve government provisions.) In the absence of quotas, targets are another, albeit lesser, option. Quotas are particularly powerful because they contain inherent accountability and urgency, whereas targets do not. That said, educators and corporations are incentivized to hit targets to adhere to the public, their funders, and general supporters, so it is not an entirely lost cause.</h2>
      <h2>
        Opponents of diversity initiatives (and often more specifically, quotas), tend to bring up the standard tropes: fear of lowering the bar, discrimination against the majority, or insulting minorities by reducing them to mandated additions instead of inclusion by merit. These repudiations fall short of acknowledging --and in some cases directly support-- systemic inequality. To believe that to include minorities will “lower the bar” insinuates that we are less capable as-is. The fear of discriminating against the majority simply overlooks the intention to support groups of people with deep histories of discrimination and inequality. And finally, that we are ultimately insulting underrepresented people with quotas is ironic because lack of opportunity to start is, in many ways, the ultimate insult.</h2>
      <h2>
        To be fair, when you look at progressive communities that have instituted policies relating to diversity and inclusion quotas, the results have not been an avalanche of societal and business improvements that many had hoped for. For example in Norway, a country which <a href="https://www.norway.no/en/missions/eu/about-the-mission/news-events-statements/news2/sharing-norways-experience-with-gender-quotas-for-boards">mandated that 40% of their board seats be held by women</a> a decade ago, did not necessarily see an overwhelming spike in company productivity, or a higher placement of women in roles throughout Norwegian companies, as many proponents of this quota had hoped would happen. But these results do not undermine the importance of equality. In fact, they should still be celebrated because Norway continues on with a productive, much more diverse workforce, which was accomplished within a relatively short period of time. </h2>
      <h2>
        In 2014, California’s <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SCA5">Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 5</a>, which aimed to overturn <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/ballot/1996/prop209_11_1996.html">Proposition 209</a> and therefore allow educational institutions in California to consider race, among other factors, in their admissions processes, was withdrawn. This feels like a missed opportunity, far from a world where quotas are used to increase diversity quickly and efficiently; we can see that there is still room for my state to grow. But in the passing of Senate Bill 826, I believe we are making important progress, if only just in the world of corporate boards to start. The path towards equality and inclusion is not clear one, but there are opportunities for us to make strides that are worth exploring. With legislative quotas, as uncomfortable as they may be for some, communities will be forced to reckon with disproportionate representation and attack it head-on. This method is not without its own shortcomings, but if we are committed to a future that is equal, diverse, and representative, quotas can make a huge difference.
