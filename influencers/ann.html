      <h1><b>ANN FRIEDMAN: Journalist, cohost of Call Your Girlfriend, and curator of the Ann Friedman weekly newsletter.</b></h1>
      <h3>Who are you and what do you do?</h3>
      <h2>I'm a writer and <a href="http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/">podcaster</a> and <a href="http://www.annfriedman.com/piecharts/">pie-chart-maker</a> and <a href="http://www.annfriedman.com/weekly/">newsletter sender</a>.</h2>
      <h3>If you could sit down tomorrow and interview any living being for the cover story of some Cool Awesome Publication, who would it be, and why?</h3>
      <h2>This is so hard, because the more famous someone is, the more boring their interviews tend to be. Fame makes you self-protective. So the people I'm most interested in are also people who I'm skeptical would be willing to open up for the cover of Cool Awesome Publication. That said, if I could get the <i>interview</i> tomorrow, I'd like to spend a full day with Hillary Clinton. </h2>
      <h3>You live in (and love!) Los Angeles, but are currently traveling for the holidays. Do you think travel is important (if you're privileged enough to be able to do it)? How has travel informed your work, if at all?</h3>
      <h2>Travel can be stressful and draining for me if I try to pack too much of it in. But in general, I do think it's important to see new things and meet new people and look at the world from new vantage points. I think I do some of my best work about 3-4 days after returning from travel, after I've had some time to settle back into my routine, but not so much time that I'm taking it for granted and slacking off.</h2>
      <h3>Do you ever write/publish for free? Why or why not?</h3>
      <h2>For a long time, I've had the personal rule that I only write for free if I own the platform/project. So I write for my own website, for blogs that I have an ownership stake in, for my own Tumblr, things like that. I write for free when I want freedom, when I couldn't convince an editor to pay me to write something, or when the format or topic is unconventional and would therefore require too much time to sell an editor on it. But as I type this answer, I realize that I actually do quite a few interview-type things like this, which are almost always unpaid. So there you go. I also write for free when someone has flattered me enough to ask me to share the details of my work, apparently!</h2> 
      <h3>On a slightly different note, I've noticed that occasionally in your newsletter, podcast, and even in your writing, you've made references to smoking weed and having a medical marijuana card. I, too live in California where recreational marijuana was recently legalized, but I often wonder if there are negative consequences (legally, professionally, or otherwise), for being outspoken about consuming weed. Is this something you've ever been concerned about? What are the consequences (for you) for being outspoken about smoking weed?</h3>
      <h2>I haven't experienced any negative consequences, but then again I'm an economically privileged white woman—I'm not part of a demographic that has been unfairly and disproportionately targeted by the so-called "war on drugs." That certainly plays a role in how it's received when I say that I get stoned sometimes—it's relatively low-risk for me to say that. Earlier in my career, when I was less financially secure and professionally stable, I was probably less open about it. Today, I'm aware of the federal laws, but I honestly don't think that saying I enjoy marijuana should be any more taboo than saying I enjoy a gin and tonic at happy hour. I'm not ashamed to admit it.</h2>
      <h3>What work are you most proud of from 2016?</h3>
      <h2>I set a goal of being fairly compensated for my work on the podcast and my newsletter, and I achieved it. Turning unpaid work into paid work is not easy. I'm really proud to have done it. But it took time away from my writing and other creative pursuits. I'm hoping to reset that balance a bit in 2017.</h2>
      <h3>In what ways do you believe your writing has helped the world?</h3>
      <h2>One of the most important things that cultural critics can do is put a name to something that was previously unnamed—a phenomenon, a feeling, an experience that a lot of people have had but been unable to connect to others' experience. Labels help people connect their experiences to others, and to realize that some problems are systemic and not personal. At my best, I think some of my work has done that for women.</h2>
