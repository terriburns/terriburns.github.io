      <h1><b>TIFFANY PHAM: Founder and CEO of Mogul, a platform that reaches 18MM women per week.</b></h1>
      <h3>So! Who are you, what do you do, what are you into, etc.? Give us a sense of who you are.</h3>
      <h2>I am the Founder & CEO of Mogul, a platform that reaches 18MM women per week, enabling them to connect, share information, and access knowledge from each other. I've been passionate about this mission since I was a young girl. In fact, I came up with the idea when I was 14. It's been a journey since then, filled with hard work, an incredible team, and a strong belief in the impossible.<br><br> 
        Now, Mogul is a global company, headquartered in NYC with offices in San Francisco and Paris, and accessed each day by all 196 countries and 30,470 cities worldwide. We are backed by media innovators such as Hearst and the Founders & Former Presidents of Comcast, Match, NPR, MTV, AOL, TIME, McGraw Hill Education, Diane Von Furstenberg, and Gary Vaynerchuk. In addition, we were named Winner of the 2016 Innovation & Inclusion Award, Top Site for Marketing Your Company Online by Forbes, Top Site for Finding Top Talent by Inc. Magazine, and honored by Business Insider "30 Under 30" and ELLE "30 Under 30."
      </h2>
      <h3>What is the absolute best part about being the founder and CEO?</h3>
      <h2>I am so thankful to have such a loyal and passionate team (we still have the same founding team from years ago!) to collaborate with, in order to create an impact on women worldwide. We are striving to provide women with information access, economic opportunities, and education. Each day, I feel grateful to have the opportunity to think about how greater we can accomplish this.<br><br>
        Another favorite part of my day is receiving letters and emails from young women all around the world, telling me Mogul has changed their lives and asking me for further advice. I answer every single one.</h2>
      <h3>You also have experience producing films! Can you speak a bit to that experience? </h3>
      <h2>I love producing films. I often say that producing one film is like launching an entirely new startup! Each film has a different director, cast, and crew members, all collaborating often for the first time within a limited schedule. Prior to Mogul, my favorite film to co-produce was GIRLFRIEND, which premiered at Toronto International Film Festival and enabled us to highlight different social issues that needed more global awareness.<br><br>
        It has been wonderful to integrate my previous experiences as a producer into the Mogul organization in a way that would benefit our overall growth. At the present, Mogul is supported by two divisions, one of which is called <a href="https://onmogul.com/mogul_at_work">Mogul At Work</a> and the other of which is called Mogul Studios. Mogul Studios co-creates and distributes content in collaboration with brand partners, including film studios. We recently had a women-led film called AWOL premiere at Tribeca Film Festival this past year.

      <h3>How does the current political climate, as well as the state of journalism and the internet inform the work that you do?</h3>
      <h2>We certainly observe the latest internet and journalistic innovations in real-time to ensure that we are leveraging those that would make sense for our platform's continued growth and usability -- and to make sure that women do not get left out of such technological improvements, otherwise.<br><br>
        As for the current political climate, it has grown increasingly important for Mogul to encourage women to voice their ideas and have the courage and confidence to share their insights on the platform. Currently, women represent just 15% of share of voice (on op-eds and boards), and so we must make sure that this rate does not decline further in the coming years.
      </h2> 
      <h3>What are some project developments that we can look forward to seeing from you next year?</h3>
      <h2>Throughout 2017, we will be expanding our college and high school presence worldwide and furthering our users' intergenerational relationships through <a href="https://onmogul.com/ask_a_mogul_anything">"Ask a Mogul Anything."</a><br><br>
        We will also have the public release of our mobile app, developed by our prodigious and incredible CTO & CPO, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/shane-paul-neil/top-8-millennial-chief-te_b_8957452.html">David Pham</a>. The app will provide our users among emerging markets with greater accessibility to our platform.
