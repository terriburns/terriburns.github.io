      <h1><b>JAMEEL MOHAMMED: Creative Director of KHIRY, the first luxury fashion brand to draw inspiration from outside of the Western world.</b></h1>
      <h3>Who are you and what do you do?</h3>
      <h2>Jameel Mohammed, Creative Director, KHIRY.</h2>
      <h3>How is KHIRY unique from anything else on the market?</h3>
      <h2>KHIRY is the only luxury fashion brand inspired specifically by the African Diaspora. </h2>
      <h3>With KHIRY, you channel the beauty, art, heritage and culture of the African diaspora into modern, luxurious jewelry. This seems like, a huge task. How exactly do you manage to channel so much into single jewelry pieces, and how do you measure whether or not you've done so successfully?</h3>
      <h2>I think design is really pretty intuitive. It's hard to put my finger on when the piece is done, but at a certain point you step back and it just makes sense. I think it's also really important to my own process to work just as extensively on the production of our lookbooks and editorials. Putting things together with a complete look and a complete creative direction brings a nice culmination.</h2>
      <h3>Who's influenced your work?</h3>
      <h2>It's a mix of artists, philosophers, politicians and other designers. I love the work of Djibril Mambety, Malick Sidibe, Fela Kuti, Angela Davis. Political philosopher Aime Cesaire's Negritude movement is really inspiring to me also. It's all about the importance of examining one's own culture (especially black culture) as a means of finding love for oneself, and that this love generates political power. It's really beautiful, and totally informs my process with KHIRY.</h2> 
      <h3>What developments does KHIRY have in the works? What can we look forward to?</h3>
      <h2>We'll be debuting a new collection during fashion week in February. I'm really excited to bring it fully to life.</h2>
      <h3>Where can we find you on the internet?</h3>
