        a little over a year ago i met with abhi, abhi, brittany, kim and emanuel to talk about joining the board. not gonna lie, i was pretty excited. it was freshman year, tech@nyu events were sometimes the highlight of my day and i was honestly quite flattered. <br><br>

        a year later, i want you to vote for me to co-run this club. the past year has changed me in more ways than i can count, and i have tech@nyu to thank for a lot of it. for me, this club gave me opportunity after opportunity, under the wing of some amazing mentors and let me do basically whatever i wanted to. i was originally brought on for freshman circuit, and shortly after i joined marketing. over the summer i decided that we should be at grace hopper, and then raised the money for the same. in the fall, i re-launched freshman circuit visiting 7 companies and in the spring our line up is already more than that. i also helped with recruiting, although the only successful interview i was pat of was Jeff&#39;s. <br><br>

        for me tech@nyu is like my professional playground. here i can experiment, take chances and dip my toes into things that i have no experience with, because i know that i have the help and support of extremely motivated, helpful and fortunately fairly patient peers. <br><br>

        now this is all a great fairytale, but let&#39;s get to why i should be (co)leading this club.<br><br>

        1. working relationship with terri <br>
        2. experience leading initiatives within the club and working with most teams in some capacity<br>

        here&#39;s what i want to focus on<br><br>

        1.tighter, leaner, meaner, smoother functioning board<br>
        2. diversity/outreach <br>
        3. quality of events, experiment, allow others to use tech@nyu platform<br>
