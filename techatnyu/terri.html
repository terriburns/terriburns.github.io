        I joined Tech@NYU in 2013 because I was curious and thought it seemed cool.  My impression of the club (which has been maintained over the last 1.5 years) was that the executive board was a group of scrappy, interesting, and smart kids who built cool stuff and I wanted in.  At the time, I had 0 experience with technology: I didn&#39;t know who Jack Dorsey was, never heard the terms &#39;API&#39;, &#39;VC&#39;, or &#39;cold email&#39;, and had probably written a total of 50 lines of code. I digress.<br><br>

        I&#39;ve learned so much from you all. So. much. And I&#39;m beyond grateful to have been given the chance to join this team (for reasons I&#39;m still unsure of) which has shaped my NYU experience to a degree I never fathomed.  Since joining, I&#39;ve come to believe in the power of technology to help people, to empower one another, and most importantly to provide opportunities to those who would not have them otherwise. Technology is my future, and I wouldn&#39;t have gotten here without Tech@NYU. So thank you. <br><br>

        When I think about the  future of this club, the impact we have already made, and the lives we can potentially touch, I&#39;m overwhelmed. But I believe that what we are doing is good and that it is powerful.  I also believe that we can do a better job. As a member of this team who is hopelessly dedicated to our cause, I take contributing the betterment of Tech@NYU as a personal responsibility. I <i>love</i> Tech@NYU, I believe in the work we are doing, I&#39;m humbled to be a part of this team, and I want to help us be better. So there: I want to be president.<br><br>

        Regarding my tech-sister Freia: I think we can overwhelmingly agree that Freia is one of the best things to happen to Tech@NYU. She is also one of the best things to happen to me. En lieu of our recent growth this year, it&#39;s come to both of our attentions that the best way for us to move forward is with some internal restructuring. Freia should be vice-president because with growth comes greater responsibility, which we believe can better be met with two executive leads.<br><br>

        TL;DR: I&#39;m excited for the future, I love Tech@NYU, Freia and I would be honored to lead this club, and thank you all for being inspiring and amazing. <br>
