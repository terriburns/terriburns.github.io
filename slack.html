        <h2>I'm Terri, and I love Slack. A bit about me: I'm a senior studying computer science at NYU. I work part time as a developer at <a href="http://venmo.com">Venmo</a>, and am President of <a href="http://techatnyu.org">Tech@NYU</a>, NYC's largest student technology organization. I lead a team of 25 incredible students to ship products and host events to strengthen the NYC tech community. I'm interested in product management, building diverse tech communities, and making life simpler and more efficient.<br>
          Slack has changed the way I communicate with Internet friends, IRL friends, coworkers, and fellow students. I am proud to see the tangible impact Slack has on improving people's day to day interactions. Here are some of my thoughts on directions Slack can go in the future to be even greater.</h2>

      <h2>
        <i>About half of the Slack groups that I am in consist of students.</i><br>

        Recently, a friend of mine from school (NYU) told me that they were using Slack for class discussions. I was really excited to hear it because my friend is in a non-technical major, and most of my Slack groups are for technical communities.

        <br>Slack has the potential to really improve communication for educational institutions, which is currently a desperate need. In educational settings, turnaround time for events, projects, meetings, classes, etc., are <b>much</b> faster than in corporate/professional settings. Similar to Google Apps for Education, schools could utilize a "Slack for Education" account. That would essentially be a master Slack group with highly structured admin settings. The channels in the group could be used for classes, school events, important announcements, and more. Achieving that would be a huge technical feat; it's a complex system to design and implement but has the potential to impact the education system in a really powerful way.

      <h2>
        <i>Slack gets cluttered, fast.</i><br>
        The Slack group in which I am most active is for <a href="http://techatnyu">Tech@NYU</a>, NYC's largest student technology organization, which I lead. We have periodically had to go on Slack "cleanses," where we wipe out channels that go unused. A small, but potentially really helpful suggestion, would be to have Slackbot automatically message a channel asking if it should be archived if it's silent for 2 weeks or so, with more options in settings to regulate this rule depending on the group. Having fewer, more meaningful channels can keep users from feeling overwhelmed when using Slack.<br>

        Additionally, a really important feature for Slack would be a feature that would allow Slack to jump straight to your mention in a channel. I regularly get mentioned in really busy channels and find myself having to dig through a ton of messages to (only sometimes successfully) find the original mention.

      <h2>
        <i>Slackbots have enhanced my Slack experience in nearly every channel.</i><br>
        Slack should encourage users (specifically non-technical users) to make bots! Bots are so useful because they can be implemented to do pretty much anything necessary for a specific group. I recently read <a href="https://medium.com/@mayafish/slackbots-for-dummies-f621d6a223dd#.ex8xyku4j">this great Medium article</a> that is a step closer towards that.

        <i>Notable Slackbots:</i><br>
        <a href="https://github.com/TechAtNYU/hubu">Hubu</a>: Tech@NYU's main bot, used to update us on GitHub stats, watch our <a href="https://github.com/TechAtNYU/hubu/blob/master/scripts/guys.coffee">language</a>, have fun, and more.
        My contribution, <a href="https://github.com/TechAtNYU/hubu/commit/e893c814a3a541984e14cecdae3dbf63f1457949">Resume Queen</a>:
        We have a #resumes channel where students regularly update their resumes and get feedback. Sometimes, people are shy to be the first to volunteer to have their resume critiqued, so Resume Queen is used to randomize the person who is to share their resume next.<br>
        <i>My Usage:</i><br>
        <b>1)</b> I use Slack everyday, probably ~3 channels<br>
        <b>2)</b> Slack is my regular mode of communication (direct message) for about 7-8 people. It has completely replaced texting, facebook messenger, and email for certain people<br>
        <b>3)</b> I use Slack for work (school, tech organizations, my part time job) as well as recreationally<br>
        <i>Why me:</i><br>
        <b>1)</b> Like many people, I use Slack all the time, but have the unique perspective of using it in both professional and educational settings, primarily within a technical context<br>
        <b>2)</b> As a critical thinker/passionate product person, I feel strongly about making experiences inclusive, unique, and meaningful<br>
        <b>3)</b> I have experience leading teams and executing ideas to tangible products<br>
        <i>My Favorite Channel, always:</i><br>
        #general. where it all starts.<br><br>
        *After speaking to members at Slack, I learned that on the desktop app, at the top right corner, it lets you see all recent mentions and jump right to them.
